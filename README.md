# BrewFinder

This app allows you to search the Open Brewery Db for breweries that are in the area searched. 

### Overview

You are able to search by Name, City, State, or any combination of the three. With the name search, it searches by key words. So say you know the name of the brewery has the word Dog in it, you can just type in Dog in the name search and it will give you all the results that contain the name dog. And a link to the working application. https://mc180g.github.io/BrewFinder/index.html
